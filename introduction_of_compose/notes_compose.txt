->  widgets of compose file 

1. version
- define "version" at top level to identified you compose file version 

2. name
x-compose-cli:
  project_name: mycustomproject
$ docker-compose -p mycustomproject up

3. blkio_config

Weight: This is a relative weight assigned to a container. The weight is used to prioritize access to block I/O resources when multiple containers are competing for the same resources. Containers with a higher weight get a larger share of the available I/O resources. The weight value is an integer, and by default, all containers have a weight of 500.
DeviceReadBps and DeviceWriteBps: These parameters allow you to set a limit on the maximum number of bytes per second (BPS) that a container is allowed to read and write to a specific block device.
DeviceReadIops and DeviceWriteIops: Similar to BPS limits, these parameters allow you to set a limit on the number of I/O operations per second (IOPS) for both read and write operations on a specific block device.

4. other

cpu_count
cpu_count defines the number of usable CPUs for service container.

cpu_percent
cpu_percent defines the usable percentage of the available CPUs.

cpu_shares
cpu_shares defines, as integer value, a service container's relative CPU weight versus other containers.

cpu_period
cpu_period configures CPU CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler) period when a platform is based on Linux kernel.

cpu_quota
cpu_quota configures CPU CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler) quota when a platform is based on Linux kernel.

cpu_rt_runtime
cpu_rt_runtime configures CPU allocation parameters for platforms with support for realtime scheduler. It can be either an integer value using microseconds as unit or a duration.

cpu_rt_period
cpu_rt_period configures CPU allocation parameters for platforms with support for realtime scheduler. It can be either an integer value using microseconds as unit or a

cpuset
cpuset defines the explicit CPUs in which to allow execution. Can be a range 0-3 or a list 0,1

cap_add
cap_add specifies additional container capabilities as strings.

cap_add:
  - ALL
cap_drop
cap_drop specifies container capabilities to drop as strings.

cap_drop:
  - NET_ADMIN
  - SYS_ADMIN
cgroup
cgroup specifies the cgroup namespace to join. When unset, it is the container runtime's decision to select which cgroup namespace to use, if supported.

host: Runs the container in the Container runtime cgroup namespace.
private: Runs the container in its own private cgroup namespace.
cgroup_parent
cgroup_parent specifies an optional parent cgroup for the container.

cgroup_parent: m-executor-abcd
command
command overrides the default command declared by the container image, for example by Dockerfile's CMD.
